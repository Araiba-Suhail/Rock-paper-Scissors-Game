This game is built using Python, allows you to compete against the computer in a best-of-five format. The game uses user input and random computer choices to create fun, text-based interactions.

Features:
- Select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Play 5 rounds, with results and scores tracked after each round.
- The game detects wins, losses, or draws intelligently.

Code Structure:
The logic relies on nested if-else statements to determine the result of each round by comparing the player’s choice with the computer’s. The game utilizes Python’s `random` module for the computer’s selection, along with loops and conditionals to manage the flow and score tracking.

After 5 rounds, a final score is displayed, and the user is prompted to replay or exit the game.
